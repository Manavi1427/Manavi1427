### Hi there, I'm Manavi 👋  
**Aspiring Data Analyst | ML & AI Enthusiast | Occasional Leader of Awesome Things**

---

🌱 I’m currently diving deep into the world of **data analysis**, with a growing specialization in **machine learning** and **artificial intelligence**. I love making sense of numbers, patterns, and possibilities.

🔍 Whether it's building smart systems or decoding messy datasets, I thrive on creating meaningful insights that drive action.

🚀 On the side, I also take on **leadership roles**—because guiding teams and building something bigger than myself is just as thrilling as a clean dataset.

### 🧠 Tools & Tech I Use

- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- SQL, Excel, Tableau, Power BI  
- Jupyter, VS Code  
- Git & GitHub (obviously 😉)  
- Some HTML/CSS/React on the side
